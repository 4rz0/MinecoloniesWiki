The Smelter is an essential worker to add after your town is established. For example, once you have a warehouse, and your miner is happily digging ores below the surface.
He or she, will take any smeltable ores; such as Iron, Gold, Coal, (or even Tinker's Ores!), as well as a fuel source and happily smelt them right into ingots for you!
