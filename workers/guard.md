\\
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 16pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guard is the protcetor of your Town. As long as you provide the Guard with a bow and/or a sword (depending on what the Guard askd for), the Guard will patrol your Town day and night. Your Guard will also take and use any armor you place in the Tower's chest or in the Guards own inventory.</span></p>
\\
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you choose a place to build his Tower, take into account the distances among the other buildings and obstacles like water, trees, caves, mountains, lava sources, etc. After you have selected a place for the Tower you have to craft the Guard Hut block in the crafting table and use your [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hwpv_c6Pbvg| Buiding Tool]] to place the building. Once you "commit" to the placement of the Guard's Hut, the block will be placed and the Guard will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best "[[Workers Info #Traits| Traits]]" for Guard if you changed this in the setting tab in the [[Town Hall #THGUI| Town Hall's GUI]].</span></p>

<p align="center"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Best Traits are: Intelligence and Strength.</span></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 18pt; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You now officially have a "Guard!" CONGRATULATIONS!</span></strong></span></p>
\\
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you will have to issue the builder the "Build" assignment so he can build the "Guard's Hut". He will be asking for the materials he/she needs. Make sure to check the "chat" regularly to see what materials the builder is requesting for any build/upgrade.</span></p>
\\
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">Hint: If you see the builder has not finished building/upgrading your farmer's hut and you don't see the builder asking for any materials, go to the builder's hut and "recall" the builder and wait a bit to see what the builder needs. Watch the Minecraft "chat" section. Also you can go to page 2 of the builder's hut GUI and check the list of materials required, any material in the list that is still missing will be in red colored letters.</span></p>
\\
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the builder is done you can now give the Guard  a bow and a sword (depending on what he/she asks for) and the Guard will start to patrol your Town, visiting all your nearby worker huts. The level of the Guard's Tower will dictate how far he/she will patrol, so if you want a longer range, be sure to upgrade the Guard's Tower.</span></p>
\\
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">Now you can access the Guard's Hut block (right click on it) and you will see a GUI with different options:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">The Guard has 2 Guard modes you can choose from: Knight or Ranger. BUT... before you can choose any of these two modes you MUST change the "Assign the guard to job:" mode from Automatically to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manually.</span></span></p>
\\
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">When the Guard is set to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Knight</span> mode, the guard will hold a sword and when set to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ranger</span> the Guard will use a bow.</span></p>
\\
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is "page 2" of the GUI. It shows the guard actions you can select: Knight or Ranger (FIRST you have to change the "Assign the guard to the job: to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manually</span> to be able to change the guard actions). Also here you will be able to set (if "Find patrol target: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manually</span>") the way the guard will work: Patrol / Follow / Guard.<br /></span></p>
\\
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">- Patrol</span> When you select this mode you have two options:<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: square;"></span></p>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">If you set "Find patrol target: Automatically", the Guard will patrol from hut to hut and back to his Tower.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">If you set "Find patrol target: Manually", you can set the patrol route when you click on "Set patrol positions". Doing so will spawn a "Guard-scepter" in your inventory. You can right click using the Guard-scepter to set a single or multiple patrol positions for the Guard to patrol back and forth.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
\\
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">- Follow</span> When you select this mode the guard will follow you around wherever you go, as your personal Guard fighting along side you or defending you.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you leave the guard tower more than 40* GuardTower level blocks the guard will automatically return to his tower.<br /></span></p>
\\
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">- Guard</span> When you select this mode you will receive a "Guard-scepter". You can right click on a block to set it as a guard spot, the guard will stay in that area until his health is low or he has to restock, then he will go the Tower and resupply/regen health and will go back to your designated the guard spot again.<br /></span></p>
