<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt; color: #3366ff;">Welcome to the Fisherman's Information Site.</span></strong></span></p>
\\
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 16pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fisherman is an important worker for your Colony. As long as you provide the Fisherman with a fishing rod, the Fisherman will provide your Town with everything that can be caught; fish. salmon, pufferfish, clownfish as well as junk and even TREASURE!</span></p>
\\
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you choose a place to build his hut, take into account that he has to be near water or that you personally will have to build him a pond close to his hut so he can fish. After you have selected a place for the hut you have to craft the Fisherman's Hut block in the crafting table and use your [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hwpv_c6Pbvg| Buiding Tool]] to place the building. Once you "commit" to the placement of the Fisherman's Hut, the block will be placed and the Fisherman will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best "[[Workers Info #Traits| Traits]]" for Fisherman if you changed this in the setting tab in the [[Town Hall #THGUI| Town Hall's GUI]].</span></p>
\\
<p align="center"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Best Traits are: Intelligence and Dexterity.</span></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 18pt; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You now officially have a "Fisherman!" CONGRATULATIONS!</span></strong></span></p>
\\
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you can give the Fisherman a fishing rod and he/she will start to fish. Also, you will have to issue the builder the "Build" assignment so he can build the "Fisherman's Hut". He will be asking for the materials he/she needs. Make sure to check the "chat" section of Minecraft regularly to see what materials the builder is requesting for any build/upgrade.</span></p>
\\
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">Hint: If you see the builder has not finished building/upgrading your farmer's hut and you don't see the builder asking for any materials, go to the builder's hut and "recall" the builder and wait a bit to see what the builder needs. Watch the Minecraft "chat" section. Also you can go to page 2 of the builder's hut GUI and check the list of materials required, any material in the list that is still missing will be in red colored letters.</span></p>
\\
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">Note: The Fisherman will require a body of water of a minimum of 7 x 7 x 1 block deep for the Fisherman to be able to work. And it must be near his hut.</span></p>

\\
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the builder is done, you can think about upgrading the Fisherman's hut to expand the range at which he/she can fish.</span></p>
\\
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">Now you can access the Fisherman's Hut block (right click on it) and you will see a GUI with different options:</span></p>
