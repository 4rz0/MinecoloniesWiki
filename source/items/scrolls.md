MineColonies adds 5 magical scrolls:

- Ultrasafe colony teleport scroll
- Ultrasafe colony group-teleport scroll
- Sacred Scroll of Regeneration
- Spatial guard reinforcement scroll

To use a scroll, hold down right-click with the scroll in your main hand. Scrolls have a small chance to fail. Whether it fails or not, the scroll will disappear after using it.

## Ultrasafe colony teleport scroll

This scroll will teleport you to your [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) when used. You must register it to your Town Hall first by shift + right-clicking on the Town Hall hut block.

It is crafted by the [Enchanter](../../source/workers/enchanter) with 3 paper, 1 compass, and 1 [build tool](../../source/items/buildtool).

## Ultrasafe colony group-teleport scroll

This scroll will teleport you and any players near you to your [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) when used. You must register it to your Town Hall first by shift + right-clicking on the Town Hall hut block.

It is crafted by the Enchanter with 3 Ultrasafe colony teleport scrolls. For the Enchanter to unlock this recipe, their [Enchanter's Tower](../../source/buildings/enchantertower) must be at least level 2.

## Sacred Scroll of Regeneration

This scroll applies the regeneration effect to you and any citizens near you. It can be found in loot chests.

## Spatial guard reinforcement scroll

Like the [Rallying Banner](../../source/items/rallyingbanner), but can only summon one tower of Guards at a time and has a finite time period. Must be registered to your Town Hall and to a [Guard](../../source/buildings/guardtower)/[Barracks Tower](../../source/buildings/barrackstower) (register it by shift + right-clicking on the hut block).

This scroll is crafted by the Enchanter with 1 Ultrasafe colony teleport scroll, 5 lapis lazuli, 1 ender pearl, and 1 paper. For the Enchanter to unlock this recipe, you must have the More Scrolls [research](../../source/systems/research) completed.

## Worker-where-are-you scroll

Highlights the worker of a specific building and gives them a slight speed boost. Shift + right-click on a hut block to use.
