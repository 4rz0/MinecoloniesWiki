## The Block

Construction tape is a unique item that automatically generates when a building is placed. It can also be used as decoration.
<br>

## The Use

Construction tape shows you the borders of buildings to be upgraded, built, repaired, or repositioned. It is placed one block outside of the building's footprint. This means the block the construction tape is on is one block outside the build zone. 
Construction tape can also be used as decoration, however, remember that construction tape is not solid and can be walked through.

### For more information on the build system, please see the [Builder](../../source/workers/builder) page.
