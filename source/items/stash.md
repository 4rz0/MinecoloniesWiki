The stash lets a player deposit items that they want to be picked up by a [Deliveryman](../../source/workers/deliveryman) to take to the [Warehouse](../../source/buildings/warehouse).

## Using the Stash

To use the stash, right-click on it to bring up the inventory, which works like a chest. Put items in the stash and a Deliveryman will pick them up.
