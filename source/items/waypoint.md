### The Item

The Waypoint is an item that can be crafted, however as a crafted item it is only used in schematics. However, using the Build Tool, you can place a waypoint for the builder to "build" and it tells the workers where to walk.

### Using the Waypoints

In schematics, you can place the waypoint block to denote where workers should walk. When travelling from place to place, they will walk through the waypoints along the way. They are in fact "points along the way". They are mostly used in Road schematics but can be used in any schematic. However, they should be used sparingly.

In a colony, placed by the builder, there are no restrictions on where they can be placed, however when a citizen is nearby they will go to it or try so make sure they are placed in appropriate and accessible locations.
