### The Item

The Stashbox is for the player to drop items to be picked up by the [Deliveryman](../../source/workers/deliveryman) to take to the [Warehouse](../../source/buildings/warehouse).

### Using the Stashbox

To use the Stashbox, right click on it to bring up the inventory. It works just like a chest, move items into the Stashbox. The Deliveryman will pick it up.
