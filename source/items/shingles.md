Shingles are decorative roofing tiles for the tops of buildings. Shingles come in all wood types, including cactus planks, and many different colors. 

There is even a shingle half slab for the crown of the roof that comes in all the colors as well.

## Using Shingles

Use shingles like you would use stairs to create roofs for buildings.
