    There is no recipe for the Ancient Tome, it must be obtained in game.

### The Item

The Ancient Tome is a glowing book that can be dropped by the Barbarians during raids. They are a fairly rare drop though, so don't expect one to drop during every raid. The Ancient Tome can not be crafted and therefore only available as a drop.

### Using the Ancient Tome

There are two uses for the Ancient Tome, one use for the player and one use for a worker.

The player use, is to have the Ancient Tome in your inventory and it will glow when there is going to be a raid that night.

The worker use, is for the enchanter, the can use the experience they collect from other workers and turn the Antient Tome into a Book of Enchantment.
