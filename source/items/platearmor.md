# Plate Armor

Plate Armor is a type of armor added by MineColonies. It is moderately durable and offers excellent protection compared to conventional iron armor, but has poor enchantability. Plate Armor is be crafted by the [Blacksmith](../../source/workers/blacksmith), after their [workshop](../../source/buildings/blacksmith) has reached level 4, and the Plate Armor research has been completed at the [University](../../source/buildings/university).

## Material Costs

| Item       | Initial Crafting Requirement    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Helmet     | 4 iron ingot, 1 leather, 1 coal |
| Chestplate | 7 iron ingot, 1 leather, 3 coal |
| Legs       | 6 iron ingot, 1 leather, 4 coal |
| Boots      | 3 iron ingot, 1 leather, 1 coal |

Like many other recipes, the Blacksmith may improve the recipe efficiency over time, reducing these costs. They will always cost at least one iron, one leather, and one coal.
