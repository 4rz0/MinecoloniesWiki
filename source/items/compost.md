## The Item/Block

There are two types of compost. There is the compost block which is used in the [Flower Shop](../../source/buildings/flowershop) schematics, and there is the compost item which is used by the [Florist](../../source/workers/florist) and the [Farmer](../../source/workers/farmer) like bonemeal.
<br>

## The Use

The [Composter](../../source/workers/composter) uses a [barrel](../../source/items/barrel) to create compost (the item). It works like bonemeal to increase the speed of plant growth. The Florist must have compost to grow flowers. The Farmer does not need compost or bonemeal to work, but prefers it.
