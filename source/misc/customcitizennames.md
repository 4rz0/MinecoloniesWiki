# Custom citizen names

Would you like to have citizen names in your own language? Then this is your page!<br>
Everything you have to change is just one file.
<br>

### Procedure
1. Locate the file _minecolonies-server.toml_.<br>
 
	For servers:<br>

		(minecraftServerFolder)/world/serverconfig/minecolonies-server.toml

	For local worlds:<br>
    
    	(minecrafFolder)/saves/(nameOfYourWorld)/serverconfig/minecolonies-server.toml
        
<br>

2. Edit
	
	You can use the official language templates we provide here or you can edit at your own risk. If so, don't forget to make a copy of the file first and follow the structure.
    <br>Edit with a text editor.
    <br>The file must have the same name.
    <br><br>
    
3. Run minecraft client/server and enjoy.
