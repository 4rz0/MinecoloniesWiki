# Custom Citizen Names

Would you like to have citizen names in your own language? Then this is your page!<br>
Everything you have to change is just one file.
<br>

### Procedure
1. Locate the file _minecolonies-server.toml_.<br>
 
	For servers:<br>

		(minecraftServerFolder)/world/serverconfig/minecolonies-server.toml

	For local worlds:<br>

		(minecraftFolder)/saves/(nameOfYourWorld)/serverconfig/minecolonies-server.toml
        

2. Edit
	
	You can use the official language templates we provide here or you can edit at your own risk. If you decide to edit, don't forget to make a copy of the file first and follow the current structure.
    <br>
    <ul>
	<li>Edit with a text editor, like Notepad.</li>
	<li>The file must have the same name.</li>
	</ul>
    <br><br>
    
3. Run Minecraft client/server and enjoy.
