# Custom Citizen Names

Would you like to have citizen names in your own language? Then this is your page!<br>
Everything you have to change is in one file.
<br>

## Procedure

1. Locate the file _minecolonies-server.toml_. For information on how to find it, see the [config file](../../source/misc/configfile) page.<br>


2. Edit

   You can use the official language templates we provide here, or you can edit at your own risk. If you decide to edit,
   don't forget to make a copy of the file first and follow the current structure.
   <br>
    <ul>
   <li>Edit with a text editor, like Notepad.</li>
   <li>The file must have the same name.</li>
    </ul>


3. Run Minecraft client/server and enjoy!
