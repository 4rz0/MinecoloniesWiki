# About the Shepherd's Hut

The Shepherd's Hut is where the Shepherd will breed and butcher cows for food and wool. You will have to capture and bring in two sheep to the Shepherd's Hut, as the Shepherd will not catch and bring in any sheep.

**Note:** The Shepherd will only keep alive two sheep per hut level, so at level 5 they will have ten sheep in their holding pens to breed and butcher. This means they will be faster at producing and collecting meat and wool. So:


| Building Level | Sheep Housed |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 8 |
| 5 | 10 |  

# Shepherd's Hut GUI

When accessing the Shepherd's Hut block by right-clicking on it, you will see a GUI with different options:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shepherd's Hut 5:</strong> This tells you the building you have selected is a Shepherd's Hut with build level 5.</li>
      <li><strong>Worker Assigned:</strong> Tells you the worker assigned to the Shepherd's Hut and their worker level. The worker levels up in time by working. The higher the level, the faster and more efficient they will be.</li>
          <li><strong>Manage Workers:</strong> Lets you change which worker is assigned to be the Shepherd. There can only be one Shepherd at each Shepherd's Hut. <b>Note:</b> this only works if you have turned the worker hiring mode in the [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) block to manual, otherwise your citizens will be hired automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Recall Worker:</strong> Recalls the Shepherd to their hut block. You might use it if they are stuck somewhere, you want to see what they have, or want to give them something directly.</li>
      <li><strong>Build Options:</strong> Lets you create a build, upgrade, reposition, or repair build order for the Shepherd's Hut. To learn more about the building system, please visit the [Builder](../../source/workers/builder) page.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery Priority:</strong> You can set the priority that a [deliveryman](../../source/workers/deliveryman) will visit this hut (ten is the highest, one is the lowest). You can also set whether it is automatic, meaning it changes automatically, or static, meaning it stays to what you set it no matter what.</li>
      <li><strong>List of Recipes and Teach Recipe:</strong> When clicking the list of recipes button, you see all the recipes you have taught this Shepherd's Hut and can remove them. When clicking teach recipe, it opens a 3x3 crafting grid which allows you to teach this hut recipes (not the worker). <b>Note:</b> you don't need to teach the Shepherd's Hut any recipes for the Shepherd to do their job.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Here you can access the hut block's storage, where the Shepherd takes their materials and deposits their meat and wool. They will also use any [racks](../../source/decoblocks/rack) or chests in the hut, so be sure to check those as well!</li>
    </ul>

Page 2 of the GUI is where you can tell the shepherd whether or not to dye their sheep. If this is turned on, the shepherd will randomly choose a color to dye their sheep.
