# About the Chicken Herder's Hut

 The Chicken Herder's Hut is where the Chicken Herder will raise chickens, collect eggs, and butcher chickens for food. You will have to capture and bring in two chickens to the Chicken Herder's Hut, as the Chicken Herder will not catch and bring in any chickens.

**Note:** The Chicken Herder will only keep alive two chickens per hut level, so at level 5 they will have ten chickens in their holding pens to breed and butcher. This means they will be faster at producing and collecting meat, drops, and other byproducts, like eggs. So:


| Building Level | Chickens Housed |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 8 |
| 5 | 10 |

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chicken Herder's Hut 5:</strong> This tells you the building you have selected is a Chicken Herder's Hut with build level 5.</li>
      <li><strong>Worker Assigned:</strong> Tells you the worker assigned to the Chicken Herder's Hut and their worker level. The worker levels up in time by working. The higher the level, the faster and more efficient they will be.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage Workers:</strong> Lets you change which worker is assigned to be the Chicken Herder. There can only be one Chicken Herder at a time. <b>Note:</b> this only works if you have turned the worker hiring mode in the [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) block to manual, otherwise your citizens will be hired automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Recall Worker:</strong> Recalls the Chicken Herder to their hut block. You might use it if they are stuck somewhere, you want to see what they have, or want to give them something directly.</li>
      <li><strong>Build Options:</strong> Lets you create a build, upgrade, reposition, or repair build order for the Chicken Herder's Hut. To learn more about the building system, please visit the [Builder](../../source/workers/builder) page.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery Priority:</strong> You can set the priority that a [deliveryman](../../source/workers/deliveryman) will deliver requested materials and take meat and other byproducts to the [warehouse](../../source/buildings/warehouse) (ten is the highest, one is the lowest). You can also set whether it is automatic, meaning it changes automatically based on if the Chicken Herder has any requests (among other factors), or static, meaning it stays to what you set it no matter what.</li>
      <li><strong>List of Recipes and Teach Recipe:</strong> When clicking the list of recipes button, you see all the recipes you have taught this Chicken Herder's Hut and can remove them. When clicking teach recipe, it opens a 3x3 crafting grid which allows you to teach this hut recipes (not the worker). <b>Note:</b> you don't need to teach the Chicken Herder's Hut any recipes for the Chicken Herder to do their job.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Here you can access the hut block's storage, where the Chicken Herder takes their materials and deposits their flowers. They will also use any racks or chests in the hut, so be sure to check those as well!</li>
