The Archery building is where you train your rangers to level up without risk of dying to mobs. The number of students depend on the level of the building. 

| Archery Level | Max # of Students |
| :----: | :----: |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 5 |

The students require a bow to practice. They will stand on or near the glowstone in the floor/ground and shoot at the targest, a bail of hay on a fence post. 

The students of the Archery are not actual guards even though they will be dressed as guards, it the usual ranger clothes. They will go to their own house at night to sleep. 

Before you choose a place to build the Archery, take into account the distance you want it from the other "military" buildings, while it isn't required to be near the barracks or combat academy, you may want to have a "military complex" area.

After you have selected a place for the Archery building you have to craft the Archery block in the crafting table and use your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool) to place the building. Once you commit to the placement of the Archery hut, the block will be placed.

You now officially have a Archery Hut, **CONGRATULATIONS!**

Now you will have to issue the builder the “Build” assignment so it can build the “Archery”. It will be asking for the materials it needs. Make sure to check the “chat” regularly to see what materials the builder is requesting for any build/upgrade.

**Hint:** If you see the [Builder](../../source/workers/builder) has not finished building/upgrading your Archery and you don’t see the builder asking for any materials, go to the builder’s hut and “recall” the builder and wait a bit to see what the builder needs. Watch the Minecraft “chat” section. Also you can go to page 2 of the builder’s hut GUI and check the list of materials required, any material in the list that is still missing will be in red colored letters.

Now you can access the Archery block (right click on it) and you will see a GUI with different options:

    <p>The Archery and it's current Level. And the buttons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manage Workers: </strong> This is where you assign student Archers to the building. 
      <li><strong>Recall Worker: </strong> This is where you recall the studen Archers to the hut building.
      <li><strong>Build Options: </strong> This is where you can upgrade the building, change the schematic "style' you currently have built. You can change the style to see the list of items required for other styles, but it's not recommended that you build a different style from here since it will most likely be in a different position. As well as reposition the building, or Repair the building, so the builder can recreate the original building (at the current level) and fix any broken, missing or unwanted addons to the original building.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery Priority: </strong> You have two options, Automatic (the mod will change this depending on the level of the building) or Static, where you can choose the priority level. 1/10 is the lowest priority, 10/10 is the highest priority.</li>
      <li><strong>List Recipes:</strong> This is where any recipes that the students know are kept.</li>
      <li><strong>Teach Recipes:</strong> This is where you can teach the students any recipe that can be created in a 2x2 crafting grid. </li>
      <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> This is the most important button. Here you can access the buildings storage from where the worker takes and deposits materials, tools and anything they find along the way (citizens will pickup anything in their path that is considered a drop; saplings, seeds, rotten flesh, bones, arrows, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
