The Mystical Site is a simple building to increase a colony's overall [happiness](../../source/systems/happinessandsaturation) level. It has no worker, and increases colonists' happiness just by existing.

**Note:** In the future, it will be expanded to have more uses.

## Mystical Site GUI

When accessing the Mystical Site's hut block by right-clicking on it, you will see a GUI with different options:

<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/mysticalsitegui.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Mystical Site GUI">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md"><br><br>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Mystical Site Level:</strong> This tells you the type of hut and the build level of the building you have selected.</li>
      <li><strong>Build Options:</strong> Lets you create a build, upgrade, reposition, or repair build order for the Mystical Site. To learn more about the building system, please visit the <a href="../../source/workers/builder">Builder</a> page.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Here you can access the Mystical Site's storage, where you can store anything you like. No citizen uses it.</li>
      <li><strong>Chest icon:</strong> Click this button to see all the items in the hut's storage (including the hut block's inventory and any racks/chests that came with the hut). Clicking the ? button next to an item's count will highlight the storage container it's in.</li>
    </ul>
