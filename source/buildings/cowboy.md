# About the Cowboy's Hut

The Cowboy's Hut is where the Cowboy will breed, butcher, and milk (if you have the option enabled) cows for food and leather. You will have to capture and bring in two cows to the Cowboy's Hut, as the Cowboy will not catch and bring in any cows.

**Note:** The Cowboy will only keep alive two cows per hut level, so at level 5 they will have ten cows in their holding pens to breed and butcher. This means they will be faster at producing and collecting meat and leather. So:


| Building Level | Cows Housed |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 8 |
| 5 | 10 |  


# Cowboy's Hut GUI

When accessing the Cowboy's Hut block by right-clicking on it, you will see a GUI with different options:

    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cowboy's Hut 5:</strong> This tells you the building you have selected is a Cowboy's Hut with build level 5.</li>
      <li><strong>Worker Assigned:</strong> Tells you the worker assigned to the Cowboy's Hut and their worker level. The worker levels up in time by working. The higher the level, the faster and more efficient they will be.</li>
          <li><strong>Manage Workers:</strong> Lets you change which worker is assigned to be the Cowboy. There can only be one Cowboy at a time. <b>Note:</b> this only works if you have turned the worker hiring mode in the [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) block to manual, otherwise your citizens will be hired automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Recall Worker:</strong> Recalls the Cowboy to their hut block. You might use it if they are stuck somewhere, you want to see what they have, or want to give them something directly.</li>
      <li><strong>Build Options:</strong> Lets you create a build, upgrade, reposition, or repair build order for the Cowboy's Hut. To learn more about the building system, please visit the [Builder](../../source/workers/builder) page.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery Priority:</strong> You can set the priority that a [deliveryman](../../source/workers/deliveryman) will deliver requested materials and take meat and other byproducts to the [warehouse](../../source/buildings/warehouse) (ten is the highest, one is the lowest). You can also set whether it is automatic, meaning it changes automatically, or static, meaning it stays to what you set it no matter what.</li>
      <li><strong>List of Recipes and Teach Recipe:</strong> When clicking the list of recipes button, you see all the recipes you have taught this Cowboy's Hut and can remove them. When clicking teach recipe, it opens a 3x3 crafting grid which allows you to teach this hut recipes (not the worker). <b>Note:</b> you don't need to teach the Cowboy's Hut any recipes for the Cowboy to do their job.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Here you can access the hut block's storage, where the Cowboy takes their materials and deposits their meat and leather. They will also use any [racks](../../source/decoblocks/rack) or chests in the hut, so be sure to check those as well!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is page two of the GUI. It shows one <br>button:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Collecting Milk:</b> On by default. In this mode you provide the Cowboy with as many empty buckets as you like and in return he will milk the cows and give you back buckets of milk (along with the meat and leather). You can click the button to turn off this mode, and the Cowboy will only breed and butcher the cows, not milk them.</li>
