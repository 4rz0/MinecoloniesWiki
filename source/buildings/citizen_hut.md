# Citizen Hut

The Citizen Hut is the *BEST* way for you to get more Citizen's for your Town. After you have crafted the Citizen Hut block, use your [Buiding Tool](../../source/tutorials/building_tool) to place the building.

<br><br>

The building will virtually house your Citizens. Each level of the Citizen Hut will "house" 1 Citizen. So: 


| Building Level | Citizens "Housed" |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 5 |

<br><br>
- **Note:** For additional Citizens to spawn, you first have to have enough space in your Citizen Hut(s) to "house" your first 4 Citizens.

- **For example:** 
<p>1 Citizen Hut level 4 = 4 Citizens... or<br>
2 Citizen Huts level 2 = 4 Citizens... or<br>
1 Citizen Hut level 1 and 1 Citizen Hut level 3 = 4 Citizens... or even<br>
4 Citizen Huts all level 1 = 4 Citizens.</p>

You can build/upgrade as you like, as long as the total building level equals 4. That will "house" your initial 4 Citizens, in any combination you want. Awesome, right?

After you have created enough space for your 4 initial Citizens, then the next level of a Citizen Hut you upgrade (or next Citizen Hut you build) will spawn the next Citizen. And so on.. build/upgrade as much as you like and every new build or upgrade level afterwards will "spawn" another Citizen for your Town.

## Hut GUI

When accessing the Citizen's Hut block (right clicking on it) you will see a GUI with different options:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/citizenhutgui.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Citizen Hut GUI">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> This the GUI for the Citizen's Hut. It show the build "level" of the Hut. And the buttons:</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Build/Upgrade Building.- </strong>to create the build/upgrade work order for this building.</li>
      <li><strong>Repair Building.- </strong> So the builder can recreate the original building (at the current level) and fix any broken, missing, unwanted addons to the original building.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory.- </strong>This is just an Inventory space where you can store anything you like. Here you can access the buildings storage.</li>
    </ul>
