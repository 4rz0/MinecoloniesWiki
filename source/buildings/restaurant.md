# About the Building

Once the building is built, Cook will start making steak, pork chops, baked potatoes, cooked fish and more right away.

**Hint:** Once the build is done, you should think about upgrading the Restaurant so that the worker can make more steak, pork chops, baked potatoes, cooked fish, etc at a faster pace.


# Restaurant Hut GUI

When accessing the Restaurant's Hut block (right clicking on it) you will see a GUI with different options:

<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/restaurantgui1.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Restaurant GUI">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <p>The Worker assigned and it's Level. (The worker levels up in time by working. The higher the level the faster and more efficient it will be). And the buttons:</p>
    <ul>
      {% for item in site.data.gui.global %}
        <li><strong>{{ item.button }}:</strong> {{ item.content }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

Page 2 is where you can tell the cook what items to use as fuel.
