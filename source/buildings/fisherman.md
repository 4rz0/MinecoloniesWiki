# About the Fisherman's Hut

The Fisherman's Hut is where the Fisherman will catch fish. The Fisherman requires a fishing rod and a body of water of a minimum of 7 x 7 x 1 blocks to be able to work, and the water must be near his hut.

Upgrading the Fisherman's Hut will expand the range at which the Fisherman can fish, and the higher the level of the Fisherman's Hut, the more loot the Fisherman will be fishing out (instead of fish). You can also give the Fisherman an enchanted fishing rod when their hut is level 5 and reap the benefits of the treasures they will be catching for you.

# Fisherman's Hut GUI

When accessing the Fisherman's Hut block by right-clicking on it, you will see a GUI with different options:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fisherman's Hut 5:</strong> This tells you the building you have selected is a Fisherman's Hut with build level 5.</li>
      <li><strong>Worker Assigned:</strong> Tells you the worker assigned to the Fisherman's Hut and their worker level. The worker levels up in time by working. The higher the level, the faster and more efficient they will be.</li>
          <li><strong>Manage Workers:</strong> Lets you change which worker is assigned to be the Fisherman. There can only be one Fisherman at each Fisherman's Hut. <b>Note:</b> this only works if you have turned the worker hiring mode in the [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) block to manual, otherwise your citizens will be hired automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Recall Worker:</strong> Recalls the Fisherman to their hut block. You might use it if they are stuck somewhere, you want to see what they have, or want to give them something directly.</li>
      <li><strong>Build Options:</strong> Lets you create a build, upgrade, reposition, or repair build order for the Fisherman's Hut. To learn more about the building system, please visit the [Builder](../../source/workers/builder) page.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery Priority:</strong> You can set the priority that a [deliveryman](../../source/workers/deliveryman) will deliver fishing rods and take fish and loot to the [warehouse](../../source/buildings/warehouse) (ten is the highest, one is the lowest). You can also set whether it is automatic, meaning it changes automatically, or static, meaning it stays to what you set it no matter what.</li>
      <li><strong>List of Recipes and Teach Recipe:</strong> When clicking the list of recipes button, you see all the recipes you have taught this Fisherman's Hut and can remove them. When clicking teach recipe, it opens a 3x3 crafting grid which allows you to teach this hut recipes (not the worker). <b>Note:</b> you don't need to teach the Fisherman's Hut any recipes for the Fisherman to do their job.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Here you can access the hut block's storage, where the Fisherman takes their fishing rods and deposits their fish and loot. They will also use any [racks](../../source/decoblocks/rack) or chests in the hut, so be sure to check those as well!</li>
