## The Item
<br>
Construction tape is a unique item in that it automatically generates when a building is placed. It is placed one block outside of the building's footprint. This means the block the construction tape is on, is not in the build zone.

## Using the Construction Tape

While there isn't a "use" for construction tape, it can be used as decoration. And some of the schematics do use construction tape, however remember that the construction tape is not solid. I can be walked through.
