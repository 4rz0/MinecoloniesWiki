## The Item

The Shingles are decorative shingles for the tops of buildings. Shingles come in all wood types, including Cactus Planks added by Structurize, and come in many colors. 

There is even a shingle half slab for crown of the roof that comes in all the colors as well.

## Using the Shingles

Use the shingles like you would use stairs to create roofs for buildings.
