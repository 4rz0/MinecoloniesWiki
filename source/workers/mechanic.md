Welcome to the Mechanicâ€™s Information Site.

The Mechanic is an important part of the supply production of the your Colony. The Mechanic will craft redstone, rails and rail carts, and many other items that no other crafters can make. 

Click here for full information about the [Mechanic's hut](../buildings/mechanic) block and using your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool). Once the hut is placed, the Mechanic will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best [Traits](../systems/workerinfo) for a Mechanic if you changed this in the setting tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

You now officially have a Mechanic, **CONGRATULATIONS!**
