The Stone Smelter is a very important addition to help automate your colony. The Stone Smelter will use their furnace(s) to smelt cobblestone into stone, clay into terracotta, and other smelts when they receive a request from another worker. 

The Stone Smelter will require fuel to use in their furnace(s).
