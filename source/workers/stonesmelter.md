Welcome to the Stone Smelterâ€™s Information Site.

The Stone Smelter is a very important addition to help automate your Town. The Stone Smeltery will have a worker called the Stone Smelter, which will essentially use the furnace to cook stone for your Towns needs. The Smelter will require fuel to use in the furnace(s).

Click here for full informationa about the [Stone Smeltery's Hut](../buildings/stonesmeltery) block and using your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool). Once the hut is placed, the Stone Smelter will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best  [Traits](../systems/workerinfo) for Stone Smelter if you changed this in the settings tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

You now officially have a Stone Smelter! **CONGRATULATIONS!**

The Stone Smelter will start to stone blocks for all your Towns needs upon request.
