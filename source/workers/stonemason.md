The Stonemason is part of your colonyâ€™s crafting line. The Stonemason can craft items and blocks made entirely out of cobblestone, stone, andesite, diorite, granite, quartz, nether bricks, purpur, prismarine, sandstones, and/or ores (no ingots). They can also craft end stone, but only if you have researched the Know the End research in the [University](../../source/buildings/university). The Stonemason will only make items when they have been taught the recipes, receive a request for an item, and have the needed materials.

**Note:** The Stonemason can only learn a set number of recipes based on their hut level. So:

| Hut Level | Recipes |
| --------- | ------- |
| 1         | 10      |
| 2         | 20      |
| 3         | 40      |
| 4         | 80      |
| 5         | 160     |
