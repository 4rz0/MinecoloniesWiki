Welcome to the Knight's Information Site.

The Knight is the protecting force for your Town. As long as you provide the Knight with a sword, the Knight will protect your Town day and night. Your Knights will also take and use armour you place in the Tower's Hut inventory or in the Knights own inventory.

Click here for full information about the [Guard Tower](../buildings/guardtower) or [Barracks](../buildings/barracks) block and using your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool). Once the Hut is placed, the Knight will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best [Traits](../systems/workerinfo) for Knight if you changed this in the settings tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

You now officially have a Knight, **CONGRATULATIONS!**

Once the builder is done you can now give the Knight a Sword and the Knight will start to guard or patrol your Town visiting all your nearby worker huts. The level of the Guard's Tower will dictate how far it can patrol, so if you want a longer patrol range, be sure to upgrade the Guard's Tower.

**Hint:** You can give the Knight an enchanted sword and enchanted armor **_(only when Tower is level 5)_** as well and reap the benefits of the protection thye'll be able to provide and the drops the Knight will be picking up along the way.
