Welcome to the Library Student's Information Site.

The Library Student is not a production part of the Colony, but rather a way to increase the stats of your colonists that may be lacking. Even the Traits above are deciving, there are no requirements for a student. Being in the library and studying, will randomly increase their stats. The highest a stat can get is level 9. The student will be learn faster, provided that the [Deliveryman](../workers/deliveryman) (or yourself) give it all the paper to do it. 

Click here for full information about the [Library's hut](../buildings/library) block and using your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool). Once the hut is placed, the student will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best [Traits](../systems/workerinfo) for a student if you changed this in the setting tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

You now officially have a Library Student, **CONGRATULATIONS!**
