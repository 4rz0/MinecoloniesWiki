The Enchanter is a specialist part of your colony. The Enchanter will steal XP from other workers to create enchanted books that can be used on tools, weapons, and armor for your workers (or yourself). To do this, the Enchanter will also need an [ancient tome](../../source/items/ancient_tome), obtained from raiders. The ancient tome will be used up during this process.

The Enchanter can also craft some magical [scrolls](../../source/items/scrolls) upon request:

- The Ultrasafe colony teleport scroll, crafted with 3 paper, a compass, and the <a href="../items/buildtool">build tool</a>. (Outputs 3 scrolls.)
- The Ultrasafe colony group-teleport scroll, crafted with 3 Ultrasafe colony teleport scrolls. The Enchanter's Tower must be at least level 2 for the Enchanter to craft this scroll.
- The Spatial guard reinforcement scroll, crafted with 1 Ultrasafe colony teleport scroll, 5 lapis lazuli, 1 ender pearl, and 1 paper. (Outputs 2 scrolls.) The More Scrolls <a href="../systems/research">research</a> in the <a href="../building/university">University</a> must be completed for the Enchanter to craft this scroll.
- The Worker-where-are-you scroll, crafted with 1 Ultrasafe colony teleport scroll, 6 glowstone dust, and 2 paper. (Outputs 5 scrolls.) The More Scrolls <a href="../systems/research">research</a> in the <a href="../building/university">University</a> must be completed for the Enchanter to craft this scroll.
