Welcome to the Enchanter's Information Site.

The Enchanter is a specialist part of your Colony. The Enchanter will "steal" xp from other workers in order to use that xp to create Books of Enchantment" that can then be used on tools and weapons for your workers. In order to do this, the Enchanter will also need an Ancient Tome, obtained from Barbarians. The enchanter will be making the Books of Enchantement, provided that the [Deliveryman](../workers/deliveryman) (or yourself) give the worker Ancient Tomes. 

Click here for full information about the [Enchanter's hut](../buildings/enchanter) block and using your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool). Once the hut is placed, the Enchanter will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best [Traits](../systems/workerinfo) for a Enchanter if you changed this in the setting tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

You now officially have an Enchanter, **CONGRATULATIONS!**
