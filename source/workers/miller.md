The Miller is a part of your colony's production line. The Miller can learn 3x3 recipes made of at least 75% wood that do not include ingots, stone, redstone, or string. The Miller will also craft a few other items, including cactus planks, [shingles](../../source/items/shingles), [timber frames](../../source/items/timberframes), and [barrels](../../source/items/barrel). The Miller will only make these items when they have been taught the recipes, receive a request for an item, and have the needed materials. 

**Note:** The Miller can only learn a set number of recipes based on their hut level. So:

| Hut Level | Recipes |
| --------- | ------- |
| 1         | 10      |
| 2         | 20      |
| 3         | 40      |
| 4         | 80      |
| 5         | 160     |
