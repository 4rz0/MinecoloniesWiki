The Deliveryman is a critial part of the bloodline of your colony. They will run from worker's hut to [Warehouse](../../source/buildings/warehouse) to worker's hut, visiting all your workers and delivering the tools and materials they need as well as taking their production to the Warehouse.

The level of the Deliveryman's Hut will dictate how much materials/tools the Deliveryman can carry to/from Huts - Warehouse - Huts, so if you want them to carry more materials/tools, upgrade the Deliveryman's Hut. Also, the higher the level of the hut, the faster the Deliveryman will run.

| Deliveryman's Hut Level | Max Stacks Carried |
| :---------------------: | :----------------: |
| 1                       | 1                  |
| 2                       | 2                  |
| 3                       | 4                  |
| 4                       | 5                  |
| 5                       | unlimited          |

### Note: You MUST build the Warehouse to at least level 1 so the Deliveryman can do their work.

### Note: You can have up to 10 Deliverymen per Warehouse. The default configuration only allows for 1 Warehouse, but this can be changed. However, Deliverymen assigned to subsequent Warehouses will only see the items in the Warehouse they are assigned to.
