Welcome to the Crusher's Information Site.

The Crusher is another part of your Colony's production line. The Crusher will crush materials into other materials.

The default configuration is:
Cobblestone into Gravel
Gravel into Sand
And Sand into Clay

However you can change this in the configuration file. This also works with modded items. Anything can be added here, it is up to the player and the server owner.

Click here for full information about the [Crusher's hut](../../source/buildings/crusher) block and using your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool). Once the hut is placed, the Crusher will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best  "[Traits](../systems/workerinfo)" for a Crusher if you changed this in the settings tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

You now officially have a "Crusher!" **CONGRATULATIONS!**

**NOTE:** You will need to tell the crusher what you want them to crush.

| Building Level | Daily Max |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1 | 16  |
| 2 | 64  |
| 3 | 144 |
| 4 | 256 |
| 5 | 999 |

The Crusher works on a 2:1 Ratio, so for example it takes 2 cobblestone to get 1 gravel.
