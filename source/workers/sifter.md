Welcome to the Sifter's Information Site.

The Sifter is another part of your Town’s production line. The Sifter will sift materials to find hidden ores, seed and other useful items and ingredients. 

The default configuration is:
        Dirt
        Sand
        Gravel
        Soul Sand

However you can change this in the configuration file. This also works with modded items. Anything can be added here, it is up to the player and the server owner.

Click here for full information about the [Sifter's hut](../../source/buildings/sifter) block and using your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool). Once the hut is placed, the Sifter will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best  "[Traits](../systems/workerinfo)" for a Sifter if you changed this in the settings tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

You now officially have a "Sifter!" **CONGRATULATIONS!**

Now you will have to issue the builder the “Build” assignment so it can build the “Sifter’s Hut”.

Once the builder is done, you will need to tell the Sifter what you want them to sift.

| Building Level | Daily Max |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1 | 16  |
| 2 | 64  |
| 3 | 144 |
| 4 | 256 |
| 5 | 999 |

The Sifter can use 4 different meshs, the String is the default option however if you want to use the flint, iron or diamond meshes, they need to be purchased. The "buy" option will show up if you have flint, iron ingot or diamonds in your inventory.
