Welcome to the Builder’s Information Site.

The builder is the *most* important worker for your colony. As long as you provide the builder with all the resources it asks for, the builder will build and upgrade all of your town buildings, workers' huts, decorations and your personal schematics. 

**Before you build *any* building, you need to build the Builder's Hut. Without the builder’s hut being built, the builder cannot build any other building.**

For full information about the Builder’s Hut block and place it with your [Builder's hut](../../source/buildings/builder). Once the hut is placed, the builder will be automatically be assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best [Traits](../../source/tutorials/worker_info) for a builder if you changed this in the settings tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

You now officially have a builder, **CONGRATULATIONS!**

- **Note:** The Builder may *ONLY* build or upgrade any other Worker's hut up to the level of it's own hut. So, in order for the builder to upgrade any building, the Builder's Hut *MUST* be upgraded first. Then they will be able to upgrade any other building(s).

<br><br><br><br><br>

## A few things to consider

The builder will not start another build assignment until they have finished the current one.

You can go to the [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) and click on the Work Orders tab and cancel the current build as well as arrange the priorities of the following build orders. If you cancel a work order, when you assign the build again, the builder will continue where they left off.

Any block the builder removes (dirt, wood, planks, glass, etc.) while building and/or upgrading they will keep in their inventory until their inventory becomes full, or they may dump unnecessary items at the end of a build/upgrade.
