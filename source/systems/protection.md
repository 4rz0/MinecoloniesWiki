# Town Protection

Our Custom Protection System (once a Townhall is placed) can be toggled in the config (file or in-game menu).
The custom protection includes turning explosions off (by default), to have creepers, TNT and any modded blocks not destroy your area.
It also covers from Y = 0 to y = 256, so you don't have to worry about any griefing from bedrock to sky limit.

**Note:** The Protection system depends on the claim system. Only areas that are "claimed" will have the protection system. See Town Claim Modes for complete information.

#### Configuration Options:

**_Config file values:_**

```
# Should the colony protection be enabled?
B:enableColonyProtection=true
```

```
# Independent from the colony protection, should explosions be turned off?
B:turnOffExplosionsInColonies=true
```

```
# Should players be allowed to build their colonies over existing villages?
B:protectVillages=true
```

**_Or in-game through the "mod Options" button; _**
