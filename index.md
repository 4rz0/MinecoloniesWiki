# Welcome to the Minecolonies Wiki!

### About our Mod

Minecolonies is an interactive Town building mod that allows you to create your own thriving Town within Minecraft. It lets you use your imagination and skills by providing you with many options to build your own Town and enhance your gaming experience. Featuring NPC workers such as: Builder, Farmer, Fisherman, LumberJack, Guard, Miner, Smeltery, Baker, Cook/Restuarant, Deliveryman, four types of Animal Herders, Composter and many more are being developed and added as the mod grows. Also specialized buildings such as: Warehouse, Citizen Huts, Townhall, Barrack and a Library. Minecolonies gives you the flexibility to create a colony as rich and unique as every player. With so many options you'll build a different Colony every time, adapt it to any biome and terrain, build inside a mountain, on top of it, under the ocean or in the Sky. The limit is your imagination!

### It's Your Way Always

You have full control of how you build your Town. You determine what type of workers you want or need, how many, where they will live, and hire or fire them as you see fit. Create a Town at your own pace. You design the Town and develop it how ever you like. You are the architect, the administrator, the boss... the ruler of your Town!

### Security and Food Chain

Your Town also deserves the best security you can imagine. Strategically add Guard Towers or place a Barrack to protect your Town from hostile night mobs and also barbarians that will attack on random nights. Give them the best weapons and armour your Town can produce and watch them patrol and fight them off! 
    All your Citizens need to be fed well to keep strong and healthy, to work and protect it better. Build a farmer (or two or three) to supply the baker maybe also a fisherman and/or some animal herders to supply the cook at the restaurant. Have the best stocked Town for your hard working Citizens to feast upon! 

### Server and Multiplayer

Minecolonies has it's own complete multiplayer system. Our permission system sets every Town placed as prtoected from blasts and unwanted access from other players. It allows for collaborative team play in multiplayer where you can assign different roles in a Town such as; Officer, Friend, Neutral or even as Hostile! With individual permissions for each group that can be changed in the Townhall to better suit your needs. You can have individual competing colonies at the same time, all with a strong protection system for server management and Anti-Griefing!
    Or... go all out war against other Towns, pick a team color and declare war on other Towns, take your guards and PVP against other Towns. (configurable server side as well). Fun for all!
